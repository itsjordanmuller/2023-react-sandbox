Embraced JavaScript features like mapping over arrays and object destructuring within React components.

##### `List.jsx` - Mapping Through an Array
In `List.jsx`, I utilized the JavaScript `map` function to iterate over an array of people and render a `Person` component for each item. This exercise demonstrated the seamless integration of JavaScript array methods within JSX to dynamically render a list of components. The use of the `map` method here is a fundamental technique in React for rendering lists of data.

##### `Person.jsx` - Conditional Rendering and Optional Chaining
`Person.jsx` presented a more nuanced challenge. The goal was to display information about a person, including their image. I used optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access nested properties of an object without causing an error if a certain link in the chain is `null` or `undefined`. This is particularly useful in situations where data may be incomplete or inconsistently structured. 

Overall, these exercises emphasized the importance of JavaScript proficiency in React development. They illustrated how fundamental JavaScript concepts and newer features can be effectively applied in React to create dynamic, flexible, and resilient user interfaces.
